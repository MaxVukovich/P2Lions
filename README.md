# Bubble Sort Lab

- | Requirement | Ahmad Nasim 5/5 verified by Anthony's Explanation | |
| ------------- | ----------- | ----------- |
|  Build individual section into your Scrum Team project for execution | Done by creating blueprints for the minilabs using buttons and seperate app.py |  |
|  Build sort using different data types (Characters, Integer, String) | Sorting code was created using characters and integer(#'s in list and #'s used in sorting) |   |
|  Build input screen for different types of data and have action button to sort each type | Used an input panel with a run button to sort the list in order and how many times the variable j was used to sort the list until least to greatest |  |
|  Display sorted results on screen | Used a website called Trinket.io for the embedding/displaying of python code |   |
| Think about using what you learned in your project (evaluate efficiency) | I discovered how and when to use Insertion Filtering (a simple sorting technique) and Selection Sorting (sophisticated sorting by sorting an array to its minimum amount, constructing an ascending order from the unsorted section, and inserting it front and). A goal for next week is to learn about selection and maybe how to sort string values. |  |

| Requirement | Max Vukovich 5/5 verified by Ahmad's Explanation | |
| ------------- | ----------- | ----------- |
|  Build individual section into your Scrum Team project for execution | Done as shown in the Max section of our blueprints that is able to be accessed with the menu at the top of the runtime |  |
|  Build sort using different data types (Characters, Integer, String) | Sorting code was created using characters and integer(#'s in list and #'s used in sorting) |   |
|  Build input screen for different types of data and have action button to sort each type | Used an input screen with a play button to sort the list in order as well as how many times it sorted to achieve the final sort |  |
|  Display sorted results on screen | Used an embedded terminal to display results and let the user use the terminal to activate the sort |   |
| Think about using what you learned in your project (evaluate efficiency) |  I learned the difference between Insertion Sorting(simple sorting algorithm) and Selection Sorting(advanced sorting by sorting an array to its minimum value creating an ascending order from the unsorted part and putting it at the front) and how I can use these sorting on the College Board FRQ Create Task for my portfolio. Since the Create Task requires a list and how it is used I can create a list that is sorted if I can not meet the requirements with my previous code |  |

- Andrew Crisostomo 5/5 verified by Max: The bubble sort lab meets all the criteria. There is an individual section, different data types are being used, an input screen and an action button is involved and the results are displayed through the use of insertion and selection. 

- Anthony Wilson 5/5 verified by Andrew: The bubble sort lab I created meets all requirements and criteria. I have an individual section you can see through each of our names, and integers and strings were used to create the bubble sort, an input screen and an action button was used and involved, results are shown throught as we used insertion and selection.

# About The Project
[![name](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72881842/112874405-c5dc7700-9077-11eb-98bb-2f762daedc7a.PNG)](http://70.95.177.55:8080/)

# Getting Started
Use this runtime link to get started.

# [Scrum Board](https://github.com/MaxVukovich/P2Lions/projects/1?fullscreen=true)
Our scrum board holds all of our progress throughout the creation period. We have "tickets" that track our process such as items to do, in progress, and done.

# Contributes 
Team Contributes will be found [HERE](https://github.com/MaxVukovich/P2Lions/graphs/contributors), this shows each contributer, with data of their contributes such as detail of commit, quantity of commit, and time of commit.
